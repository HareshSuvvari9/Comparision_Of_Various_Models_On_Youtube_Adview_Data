# Comparision_Of_Various_Models_On_Youtube_Adview_Data


experimented various machine learing models on Youtube adview data ( both train and test data uploaded in the repo ) to find best results.


Models applied are :

1.Linear regressor

2.Svm regressor

3.Decision tree regressor

4.Random forest regressor

5.Keras sequntial model

and their performance was calculated using MSE (Mean square error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) as metrics .

and each model was saved for future refernce
